## Problem Statement

[2-3 sentences describing the problem your project solves.
Who experiences this problem? Why does it matter?
What is the current way of handling it, and why is that insufficient?]

## Target Users
[Who will use this system? Be specific.
Example: "Security analysts at a mid-size company who receive 200+ alerts per day
and need automated triage to focus on critical threats."]

## Data Sources

- **Primary data:** [What data will you use? Where does it come from?]
- **Sample data:** [What sample/test data will you create or find?]
- **Data format:** [CSV, JSON, API responses, etc.]

## AI Capabilities

| Capability | Purpose | Model/API |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| [e.g., Text Classification] | [e.g., Classify alert severity] | [e.g., Hugging
Face distilbert] |
| [e.g., Summarization] | [e.g., Summarize incident reports] | [e.g., Groq LLaMA]
|

## Success Criteria
1. [Measurable criterion, e.g., "System correctly classifies 8 out of 10 test
alerts"]
2. [Measurable criterion, e.g., "Data pipeline processes all records within 2
minutes"]
3. [Measurable criterion, e.g., "Dashboard displays all enriched records with
filtering"]
4. [Measurable criterion, e.g., "All 4 components integrate and exchange data
correctly"]
5. [Measurable criterion, e.g., "Each component has its own README with setup
instructions"]
